## 🔄 Service Dependencies & Communication

### Authentication Flow
```
Client → API Gateway → Auth Service → Database
                    ↓
                User Service (for profile data)
```

### Learning Flow
```
Client → API Gateway → Content Service → Learning Progress Service
                    ↓                  ↓
                Assessment Service → Notification Service
                    ↓
                Reporting Service
```

### Organization Flow
```
Client → API Gateway → Organization Service → Subscription Service
                    ↓                      ↓
                User Service → Notification Service
```

## 📋 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Services
1. **Auth Service** - Full JWT authentication, registration, login, password reset
2. **User Service** - User profiles, learning preferences, admin management

### 🔄 Ready for Implementation
3. **API Gateway** - Request routing, authentication middleware
4. **Organization Service** - Multi-tenant management
5. **Subscription Service** - Billing and payment processing
6. **Content Service** - Course and lesson management
7. **Learning Progress Service** - Progress tracking and analytics
8. **Assessment Service** - Quiz and test management
9. **Notification Service** - Email and push notifications
10. **Reporting Service** - Analytics and reporting

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

Each service has its own dedicated PostgreSQL database:

| Service | Database | Schema Status |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| auth-service | `auth_service_db` | ✅ Created & Migrated |
| user-service | `user_service_db` | ✅ Created & Migrated |
| organization-service | `organization_service_db` | 📋 Schema Designed |
| subscription-service | `subscription_service_db` | 📋 Schema Designed |
| content-service | `content_service_db` | 🔄 To Be Designed |
| learning-progress-service | `learning_progress_db` | 🔄 To Be Designed |
| assessment-service | `assessment_service_db` | 🔄 To Be Designed |
| notification-service | `notification_service_db` | 🔄 To Be Designed |
| reporting-service | `reporting_service_db` | 🔄 To Be Designed |

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### 1. Start Core Services (Working)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Auth Service
npx nx serve auth-service

# Terminal 2: User Service  
npx nx serve user-service
```

### 2. Start Additional Services (When Implemented)
```bash
# API Gateway
npx nx serve api-gateway

# Organization Service
npx nx serve organization-service

# Content Service
npx nx serve content-service
```

### 3. Test All Services
```bash
./test-services.sh
```

## 🔧 Next Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **API Gateway** - Implement request routing and authentication middleware
2. **Organization Service** - Multi-tenant organization management
3. **Subscription Service** - Basic billing and plan management

### Phase 2: Content & Learning
4. **Content Service** - Course creation and management
5. **Learning Progress Service** - Progress tracking and analytics
6. **Assessment Service** - Quiz and test functionality

### Phase 3: Communication & Analytics
7. **Notification Service** - Email and push notification system
8. **Reporting Service** - Analytics dashboards and reports

## 📊 Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication (HTTP)
- API Gateway ↔ All Services
- User Service ↔ Organization Service
- Content Service ↔ Learning Progress Service
- Assessment Service ↔ Learning Progress Service

### Asynchronous Communication (Events)
- User Registration → Welcome Email (Notification Service)
- Course Completion → Certificate Generation (Assessment Service)
- Subscription Changes → Feature Access Updates (Organization Service)
- Learning Progress → Analytics Updates (Reporting Service)

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### JWT Token Flow
1. **Login** → Auth Service generates JWT
2. **API Gateway** validates JWT for all requests
3. **Services** receive validated user context
4. **Refresh** tokens handled by Auth Service

### Service-to-Service Authentication
- Internal API keys for service communication
- Service mesh security (future enhancement)
- Database connection security per service

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Each service can be scaled independently
- Load balancing at API Gateway level
- Database read replicas for high-traffic services

### Performance Optimization
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing and query optimization
- CDN for static content (Content Service)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each service has comprehensive unit tests
- Shared libraries have isolated tests
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- Service-to-service communication tests
- Database integration tests
- API contract testing

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete user journey testing
- Cross-service workflow validation
- Performance and load testing

## 📝 Documentation

### API Documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI for each service
- Postman collections for testing
- API versioning strategy

### Development Documentation
- Service setup guides
- Database schema documentation
- Deployment procedures

---

**All services are now generated and ready for implementation!** 🚀

The foundation is complete with proper Nx monorepo structure, shared libraries, and comprehensive documentation. Each service can now be implemented independently while maintaining consistency across the platform.
